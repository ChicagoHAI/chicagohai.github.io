# Edit content and publish

## How to edit contents
For homepage, edit `content/_index.md`.

For publication, edit `content/publication.md` and `data/papers.yml`. Here, I use a template to enumerate publications in `data/papers.yml` file. You can modify the representation in `layouts/shortcodes/listPapers.html`.

## Locally run server
run `hugo server` in base directory.

## How to publish website
After finishing editing the content, we can update static files in `docs/` by
```
# at base dir
hugo
```
,and then remember to `commit` and `push` to the repo!

To see site settings, go to `GitHub Pages` in `Settings` on github repo page. Remember to change source from `root/` to `docs/`.
