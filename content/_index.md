Welcome!

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

Our goal is to build the best AI for humans by 1) developing best practices for effective human-AI collaboration through explanations and 2) building robust models that can discover data-driven insights.
We currently work on the following areas:

* Understanding/generating explanations for human-AI interaction,
* Design and evaluation of human-AI interaction,
* Language and social dynamics,
* Emergence of communities, intergroup contact, and multi-community engagement.



We are always looking for motivated postdocs, PhD students, and undergraduates who are interested in NLP, data science, computational social science, or machine learning! Please read this [FAQ](https://chenhaot.com/faq.html) if you are interested.
