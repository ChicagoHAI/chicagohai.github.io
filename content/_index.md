Welcome!

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

Our goal is to develop a synergy between humans and artificial intelligence through a better understanding of _human behavior_ and _human interaction with AI_.
We currently work on the following areas:

* Language and social dynamics,
* Emergence of communities, intergroup contact, and multi-community engagement,
* Understanding/generating explanations for human-AI interaction,
* Design and evaluation of human-AI interaction.


We are always looking for motivated postdocs, PhD students, and undergraduates who are interested in NLP, data science, computational social science, or machine learning! Please read this [FAQ](https://chenhaot.com/faq.html) if you are interested. 

You might also find [ChicagoNLP](https://twitter.com/ChicagoNLP) and [Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence) interesting.
