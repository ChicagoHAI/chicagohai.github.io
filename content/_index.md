Welcome!

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

Our goal is to build the best AI for humans.
We are most interested in the following applications (ordered randomly):

* Governance and democratic processes,
* Healthcare,
* Scientific discoveries.

Check this [page](https://chenhaot.com) for updated research directions!


We are always looking for motivated postdocs, PhD students, and undergraduates who are interested in human-centered AI, NLP, and computational social science! Please read this [FAQ](https://chenhaot.com/faq.html) if you are interested.
