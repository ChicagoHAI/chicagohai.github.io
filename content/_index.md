Welcome!

Our goal is to develop a synergy between humans and artificial intelligence through a better understanding of _human behavior_ and _human interaction with AI_.
We currently work on the following areas:

* Language and social dynamics
* Emergence of communities and intergroup contact
* Understanding/generating explanations for human-AI interaction
* Design and evaluation of human-AI interaction


We are always looking for motivated postdocs, PhD students, and undergraduates who are interested in NLP, data science, computational social science, or machine learning! Please read this [FAQ](https://chenhaot.com/faq.html) if you are interested.
