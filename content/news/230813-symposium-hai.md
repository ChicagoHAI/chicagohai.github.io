AI has achieved impressive success in a wide variety of domains, ranging from medical diagnosis to generative AI. This success provides rich opportunities for AI to address important societal challenges, but there are also growing concerns about the bias and harm that AI systems may cause. This conference brings together diverse perspectives to think about the best way for AI to fit into society and how to develop the best AI for humans.
